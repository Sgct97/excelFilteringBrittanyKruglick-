FUZZY MATCHER TOOL - CLIENT INSTRUCTIONS
========================================

WHAT THIS TOOL DOES
-------------------
This tool finds matching people across two datasets using "fuzzy matching" - it can match names and addresses even when there are typos, abbreviations, or formatting differences.

SETUP REQUIREMENTS
------------------
‚Ä¢ Mac computer (macOS)
‚Ä¢ Excel file with your data
‚Ä¢ No additional software needed - everything is included!

HOW TO PREPARE YOUR DATA
------------------------
1. Open Excel and create a workbook with exactly 2 sheets:
   
   SHEET 1 - Small Input Data (people you want to find matches for)
   ‚Ä¢ Should have columns like: First_Name, Last_Name, Address1, City, State, Zip
   ‚Ä¢ This is typically your smaller dataset (e.g., 100-1000 rows)
   
   SHEET 2 - Master Database (large reference dataset)  
   ‚Ä¢ Should have the same column structure as Sheet 1
   ‚Ä¢ This is your large reference dataset (e.g., 10,000-100,000 rows)
   
   COLUMN NAMES: The tool accepts variations like:
   ‚Ä¢ Names: First_Name, FirstName, Last_Name, LastName, Full_Name, FullName
   ‚Ä¢ Address: Address1, Address, FullAddress, City, State, Zip

2. Save your file as .xlsx or .xlsm format

HOW TO RUN THE TOOL
-------------------
1. Double-click "FuzzyMatcher.app" to open the tool
2. Click "üìÅ Select Excel File & Process" 
3. Choose your prepared Excel file
4. Wait for processing (progress will show in the window)
5. When complete, you'll see "‚úÖ Processing complete!"

UNDERSTANDING YOUR RESULTS
--------------------------
The tool creates a NEW Excel file with timestamp (e.g., "MyData_RESULTS_20250801_143000.xlsx")
Your original file is never modified!

The results file contains:
‚Ä¢ Your original data sheets (unchanged)
‚Ä¢ 3 new results sheets with different matching strategies:

RESULTS_FULLNAME - Matches people by name only
‚Ä¢ Finds the same person even with different addresses
‚Ä¢ Example: "John Smith, NYC" matches "John Smith, Boston"

RESULTS_LASTNAMEADDRESS - Matches by last name + address
‚Ä¢ Finds people with same last name at same address
‚Ä¢ Example: "John Smith, 123 Main St" matches "Mary Smith, 123 Main Street"
‚Ä¢ Ignores apartment numbers for flexible matching

RESULTS_FULLADDRESS - Matches by full address only  
‚Ä¢ Finds anyone living at the exact same address
‚Ä¢ Example: "John Smith, 123 Main St Apt 5" matches "Mary Jones, 123 Main Street Apt 5"
‚Ä¢ Apartment numbers must match exactly

RESULT COLUMNS EXPLAINED
------------------------
Each results sheet contains these columns:
‚Ä¢ Match Score: How confident the match is (higher = better match)
‚Ä¢ Sheet A Row: Row number from your input data  
‚Ä¢ Sheet B Row: Row number from your master database
‚Ä¢ Name A: Name from your input data
‚Ä¢ Name B: Name from master database  
‚Ä¢ Address A: Address from your input data
‚Ä¢ Address B: Address from master database

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
‚Ä¢ App won't open: Right-click ‚Üí Open, then click "Open" when macOS asks
‚Ä¢ No matches found: Check that your column names match the expected format
‚Ä¢ Takes too long: Large datasets can take 30+ minutes - this is normal
‚Ä¢ Results file not found: Look for the timestamped file in the same folder as your input

TIPS FOR BEST RESULTS
--------------------
‚Ä¢ Use consistent formatting across both sheets
‚Ä¢ Review results manually for final verification

SUPPORT
-------
If you encounter issues, check that:
1. Your Excel file has exactly 2 data sheets
2. Column names follow the expected format
3. Data is clean and properly formatted
4. You have enough disk space for the results file

The tool is designed to be safe - it never modifies your original data.
