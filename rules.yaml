# === RULES (STRICT) ===

1) FAIL-FAST. NO FALLBACKS.
- If any step cannot proceed as specified, RAISE and STOP immediately.
- Disallowed: silent retries, automatic parameter changes, alternate algorithms, schema guesswork, imputations.
- Exception (only): if the 'opens' column cannot be matched, write null/NA for 'opens', add a reason code (OPENS_NO_MATCH), and continue.
- Every raised error must include: stage, file(s), column(s), and a minimal repro hint.

2) TEST EVERY MILESTONE WITH REAL DATA.
- Use ONLY the user’s real files; zero synthetic rows, headers, or values.
- You may test on a slice of the real data, but the slice must be reproducible (e.g., fixed IDs or deterministic filters).
- Each milestone must pass: (a) schema/typing checks, (b) determinism check (identical outputs on two runs), and (c) target acceptance gates for that stage.
- If any gate fails → raise and stop (no auto “tuning” or fallbacks).

3) ABSOLUTELY NO FAKE DATA.
- Do not fabricate, mock, or “sample-generate” anything—tests, docs, examples, and screenshots must come from redacted real data only.
- If required fields are missing or insufficient, PAUSE and request real data or approval to relax requirements—do not proceed with dummies.

4) FOLLOW THE CHECKLIST (NO SKIPS).
- Treat the existing checklist as the source of truth. Read it before any new task, commit, or run.
- Do not advance past a step until every box in the current section is checked off using real data artifacts.
- Produce an artifact map for each run (what files satisfy which checklist items). If any item isn’t satisfied, raise and stop.

5) ASK BEFORE LARGE CODE CHANGES.
- “Large change” includes ANY of the following:
  - Data model/schema or I/O contract changes
  - Matching algorithm/weights/threshold strategy changes
  - Dependency additions/removals or engine swaps
  - Output columns/filenames/layout changes
  - Refactors >100 LOC in core modules or anything affecting determinism
- Before executing: post a one-paragraph proposal with: intent, exact diff summary, risks, expected impact, and rollback plan. Proceed only after explicit approval.


# SINGLE SPECIAL CASE (OPENS)
- If no match is found for 'opens': set opens = null/NA, add reason code OPENS_NO_MATCH, do not raise. All other unmatched required fields must raise.
